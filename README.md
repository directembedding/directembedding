An experimental macro-based library for Embedded DSLs.

# DirectEmbedding for DSLs


DirectEmbedding is an experimental project that attempts to provide direct embedding in Scala for Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). Although, this project is currently exploratory, this library could become a very useful tool. For instance, it could replace the complex shadow embedding of [Yin-Yang](https://github.com/scala-yinyang/scala-yinyang/tree/cbfaf02405c5e273498c15ce943965eeba8afa31) library in existing or future projects such as [Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com/).

This library provides **one** effortless logic for the reification of embedded DSLs in Scala. This comes along many **advantages**:

- no knowledge of the [Reflection API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_programming%29)
- no overloading resolution
- no dependence with types and count of arguments
- no verbosity
- no code duplication

Our solution makes use of [annotations](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/reflection/annotations-names-scopes.html) and [macros](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.11.0/scala-reflect/index.html#scala.reflect.macros.blackbox.Context) to achieve this goal.

<!--
The simplicity for the DSLs users is kept because direct embedding implies that the code to be written by the users will be done in Scala with few restrictions on it and few overhead due to the DSL synthax.
Furthermore, it also benefits the developpers of DSL because DirectEmbedding handles the difficult task of lifting the Scala AST to an Intermediate Representation (IR) thanks to macro.

# Overview
Writing embedding DSLs implies to go though the difficult task of reification. 
Reification means when a function *take(x: Int): Query[T]* is written in Scala it will be converted to a corresponding DSL object *Take*. *Take* is the Intermediate Representation (IR) of the function *take()*. The naive method would code conditionnal statements that would **identify** which function has been called. Identifying is strenuous and redundant because it must check many criteria, takes in account aspects such as overriding of the function and this for all functions or classes. It is not a best practices and it creates as much reification logics than there is cases to reify.
Hopefully, this can be facilitated by libraries and DirectEmbedding is one of them.

### Attach Metadata
The idea developed by DirectEmbedding is to attach metadata about the corresponding IR and thus it get rid of the demanding task of identification. It becomes straight forward to solve the previous issues. When it was required to verify the name of the function, its types, its types arguments, its arguments count, now this is declared along the function. Overriding? It is also very simple, it simply needs to attach the corresponding IR.

### Annotate
Scala annotations can attribute an object to declarations. Thus, annotations permits to attach metadata, that is to say, the IR. The annotation is accessible through the symbol of the AST.

### Reify
DirectEmbedding reifies the DSL while the compilation. This means that the given AST for an annotated function will be reified into the DSL representation at compile-time. In order to do so, there is the need to *pattern match* all the different ASTs that can be generated by an annotated declaration. Once the arguments, the types arguments and the symbol of the annotated code are extracted from the AST then the reification occurs via a macro. The macro applies the arguments and types arguments to the obtained IR from the symbol. The macro returns the reified tree i.e. the IR with the arguments and types arguments correctly applied. 

There is not special difficulty for the identification, DirectEmbedding does the hard task of *pattern matching* the ASTs and the macro, the solution is elegant and proposes only one reification logic. **Pretty simple!**



### An example
**On the DSL's developper side**

* Let's imagine, we want to define for a DSL a function take() that returns a Query[T]:

	```scala
		class Query[T] {
			val take(x: Int): Query[T] = ???
		}
	```

* For this DSL, the function take() should be reified into the following IR:

	```scala
		case class Take[T](self: Exp[QueryIR[T]], n: Exp[Int])
		   extends Exp[Query[T]]
	```

* Thus, the function take() needs to be annotated:

	```scala
		class Query[T] {
			@reifyAs(Take) //Annotation with its corresponding IR
			val take(x: Int): Query[T] = ???
		}
	```

**On the DSL's user side**

* One user calls the function take() in his code:

	```scala
	   lift {
	      	new Query[Movie].take(3)
	   }
	```

* The function is reified inside the compile into:

	```scala
	   Expr[T](Take.apply[Int](QueryIR.apply[Movie], 3))
	```

**What happened?**

* A Scala AST is generated and caught
* The annotation, the arguments and the type arguments are extracted
* A macro reified the AST into the result

### DirectEmbedding.scala

This file contains the reification code. It consists of the definition of:

* reifyAs()

	```scala
	   class reifyAs(to: Any) extends scala.annotation.StaticAnnotation
	```
	
	* This defines the annotation *reifyAs* which accepts *Any* object so the IR can be attach into the symbols

* and lift()

	```scala
		def lift[T](c: Context)(block: c.Expr[T]): c.Expr[T] = {
   			import c.universe._
		    class LiftingTransformer extends Transformer {
		    	...
		    }
		}
	```
	
	* This is the method that encompasses all the reification process. 

The class LiftingTransformer defines:

* reify()

	```scala
		def reify(methodSym: Symbol, targs: List[Tree], args: List[Tree]): Tree = { ... }
	```

	* This code uses the macro with its parameters to reify the captured function into its IR.
	
* and transform()

	```scala
		override def transform(tree: Tree): Tree = { ... }
	```

	* transform() *pattern matches* over the different ASTs to extract the essential data for reify() that is to say the symbol, the type arguments and the arguments.
